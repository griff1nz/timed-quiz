# Timed Quiz

## Description
- I created this website to demonstrate my ability to use web APIs in JavaScript to dynamically update the page.
- This program consists of advanced JavaScript, including functions.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
When the user presses the Start Quiz button, they will be presented with a series of questions and must select the correct answers. If the incorrect answer is selected, ten seconds will be subtracted from the remaining time. After clearing the quiz, the remaining time will be the score, and the user can type their initials. The highest score will be stored, and can be revealed by clicking the text at the top left corner of the webpage.
